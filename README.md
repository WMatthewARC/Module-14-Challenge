# Module-14-Challenge | Belly Button Biodiversity
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


## The setup: Use the D3 library to read

## Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. 
  ### Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
  ### Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)
  ### Adapt the Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
